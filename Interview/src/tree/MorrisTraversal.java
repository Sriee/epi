    /**
     * Algorithm for Morris Traversal
     * <p>
     * 1. Initialize current as root
     * 2. While current is not NULL
     * If current does not have a left child
     * i. Print currentâ€™s data
     * ii. Go to the right. Since we have visited all the nodes in the left subtree.
     * Else
     * i. Find the right most node in current's left subtree. Make current the right child of the rightmost
     * node
     * ii. If there is no right child
     * - Attach current as the right child (Note: We are creating a cycle)
     * Else
     * - Detach the successor and traverse left
     * <p>
     * How does this work without stack?
     * The reason for using a stack is to store a node that we can backtrack to when our left exploration has ended.
     * <p>
     * As we go through a parent node to which we will need to backtrack to -> we find the node which we will need to
     * backtrack from and create a link to the parent node.
     * <p>
     * When we backtrack? When we cannot go further. When we cannot go further? When no left child's present.
     * <p>
     * Where we backtrack to? Notice: to SUCCESSOR!
     * <p>
     * So, as we follow nodes along left-child path, set the predecessor at each step to point to the current node.
     * This way, the predecessors will have links to successors (a link for backtracking).
     * <p>
     * We follow left while we can until we need to backtrack. When we need to backtrack, we print the current node and
     * follow the right link to the successor.
     * <p>
     * If we have just backtracked -> we need to follow the right child (we are done with left child).
     * <p>
     * How to tell whether we have just backtracked? Get the predecessor of the current node and check if it has a right
     * link (to this node). If it has - than we followed it. remove the link to restore the tree.
     * <p>
     * If there was no left link => we did not backtrack and should proceed following left children.
